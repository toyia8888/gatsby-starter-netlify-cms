      text: In The Art Gallery Website assignment, I was hired to create a new website
        for the Watermann Gallery, an art and history museum. The director
        requested a simple yet functional site, that presents the necessary
        information in an aesthetic manner. In my approach to this assignment, I
        decided to include a Home page, Current Exhibit page, Calendar of Events
        page and a How to help page to narrow down the basics in a clear,
        well-organized manner and remain simple. I decided to use a few art
        gallery images and a few different shades of blue since the logo has the
        word water in it, I also decided to add a calendar to the calendar of
        events page. I added a few background photos to the logo as well. The
        hardest part was the image carousel on the second webpage.

        The Solar Website was created for a non-profit organization dedicated to
        increasing the use of alternative energy sources in private homes. The
        group wants to create a simple webpage to promote the benefits of home
        solar power and allow people to request more information. In this
        project this site features the client's logo, a brief explanation of the
        product and the service and a short information request form so users
        can request more information if needed, I also included artwork to fit
        the client's message and supplied content in a clear attractive manner
        as directed.

        In this assignment I was hired by the National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration (NASA) to design a new home page as the entry point to a
        site that presents general information of interest to the public at
        large. In this project I created a basic layout structure and created a
        logo treatment, I tried to include only the most common things the
        public finds of interest. In the main page I was sure to only include
        images from NASA on the Commons and links to secondary pages for each of
        the four site categories. With this format a user would easily be able
        to navigate this site

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
